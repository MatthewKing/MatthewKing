Hi, I'm Matthew King, a software engineer from Perth, Western Australia.

I build all sorts of software. I'm passionate about C# and .NET, and like to work with cutting-edge technology.
I sometimes [blog](https://mking.net/blog) about software development, and I have a few open source projects that you might find interesting.
